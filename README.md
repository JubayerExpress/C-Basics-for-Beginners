## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these C programs, you'll need to have a C compiler installed (such as `gcc`). If you don't have it installed, you can download and install GCC or another suitable compiler.

### Running the Programs

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-basics-for-beginners.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd c-basics-for-beginners
    ```

3. Compile and run the C files using the following commands:
    ```bash
    gcc src/HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld
    ./HelloWorld
    ```

### Learning Goals

By working through these examples, you will:

- Understand the basic syntax and structure of C programs.
- Learn how to declare variables and use different data types.
- Gain knowledge of control flow structures (if-else, loops).
- Work with arrays, pointers, and functions.
- Learn how to manage memory dynamically and understand data structures like linked lists.
- Handle file input/output operations in C.
- Explore basic sorting algorithms and bitwise operations.
